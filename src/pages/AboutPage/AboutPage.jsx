      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>
        My passion for programming was sparked when I was in high school. I
        created a game called “Perfect Pump” on the TI-83+ calculator. The game
        had a number displayed in currency, and the goal was to press a button
        and stop it perfectly on $20. The game was simple, but everyone really
        enjoyed it, and I vividly remember loving the feeling of making a
        program that everyone else used. I went on to take courses in C++ and
        Java, but didn’t pursue it as a career until much later in life. I
        recently helped construct a VBA macro for my former company which was
        deployed to over 300+ independent contractors. After a short time at the
        company it was obvious that many of our tasks were repetitive and needed
        automation. I took it upon myself to write this macro in an effort to
        increase efficiency, and we ended up implementing it company-wide.
        Throughout writing it, I taught myself object-oriented programming
        concepts, and reinvigorated my love affair with programming. I unlocked
        all the same feelings I had in high school after I made “Perfect Pump”.
        I enrolled into the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive
        course because I realized that this is what makes me happiest. I’m a
        natural problem solver, creative, and techie. Combining my skills and
        talents into a career is my number one goal, and I’m looking to join an
        innovative organization that’s working to solve problems both big and
        small.
